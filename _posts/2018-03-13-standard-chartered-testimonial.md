<blockquote>
  <p>
    From working together at Standard Chartered Bank, I've found Derek to be an indispensable member of the team. He's a
    highly motivated developer, not afraid to take on challenges in both familiar and unfamiliar territory, who has
    continually demonstrated an excellent grasp on web technologies. Derek has incredible talent in solving the big
    picture items in a project, able to scale a complex software system to enable a sustainable pace of development in
    small and large teams. And above all - whether he's donning his black belt in Webpack or writing elegant prose in
    code comments - Derek's an absolute joy to work with.
