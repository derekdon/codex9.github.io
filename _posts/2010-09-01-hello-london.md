Codex9 has been building cutting edge digital solutions for our clients in Ireland since 2006. Today we are excited
to announce that we have relocated our operations to London, and as such are opening our doors to London based clients
for the first time.

Our focus as we enter this new chapter will be on the London market, so unfortunately we will no longer be taking on
new clients if they are based outside of London. We will be continuing to work with all of our existing clients during
this transition. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may cause, but in these turbulent times we need to
keep moving forward.

To Ireland and all our clients, you have been great, and we wish you every success in the future.

To London, please [say hello](/contact) if your project needs our help. We look forward to working with you.

Team @ Codex9.
